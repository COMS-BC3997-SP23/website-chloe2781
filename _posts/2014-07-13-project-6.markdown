description: This week I revised my design and make the app feels more like a more AR app that shows nail rather than a nail app that has an AR functionality. I wanted to highlight the special part of the app and make sure my idea is shown more clearly. I also have the camera shown directly and user can switch between nails rather than choosing the nails first, which make the process a lot more complicated.
