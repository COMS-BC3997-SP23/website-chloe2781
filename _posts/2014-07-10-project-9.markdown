description: I followed a tutorial to set up the SignUp, SignIn, Home page, Account page, forgot password, etc. In the Account page especially, I learned how to set up a user profile picture and you can change it too, which is really cool. I needed to set up some Cloudinary things though. I really would not have thought nor looked for that. The profile page also allows users to change the password which is really cool. Also Iâ€™m not implementing any frontend yet, just the functionality first.
