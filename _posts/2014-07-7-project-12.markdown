description:  This week I finished up all the screens and boosted through the code. It was very addicting to keep adding more components to the app.I explored more options for AR integration, which is very limited. I explored Viro react, which is very useful for what I want because they have a snapchat like AR function. However, Viro react does not work with an expo management system, which is what I have, so I canâ€™t use that. I did not know there was any difference between react native expo and bare react native. Expo is not very flexible with AR integration. I also added an exploded view for each of the nail sets in the account page so that the user can view it more clearly. The user only needs to click on the exploded image again to go back to the original view. I also added a Saved page that does the same thing as Account, but in Saved, the user would be seeing the nail sets that they saved, so not just the nail sets that they created.
