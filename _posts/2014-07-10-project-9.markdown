description: This week I complete the design by adding more detailed frames. I added the design frame, which allow user to design every single nail. I also included the option for user to copy and paste the same design onto the other nail. Besides the design function, I added a search page design so people and easily look up designs or accounts so they can save the new inspirations or follow new accounts.
