description: This week was a lot of trials and fails and I wouldn’t say this is my proud moment. After searching through and using chatGPT, I finally found a tutorial to follow and I decided to switch to just the good old JavaScript. I started to implement the signIn and signUp page and it works so far. It made me very happy. The tech stack I’ve decided to use is React Native with JavaScript and the database is MongoDB.
