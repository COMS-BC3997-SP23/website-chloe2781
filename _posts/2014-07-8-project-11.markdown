description: This week I work on the frontend part for some of my pages after following the tutorial. I focused on the Home page and tried to see if I could do AR integration. The Home page works how I expected it to be visually. Functionality, I think itâ€™s a little too complicated and ambitious to try and implement the social media part of my app as I would need more complicated algorithms to suggest posts to certain users. The Camera part, however, is a little too rough as none of the AR API works with the expo management system. Many are deprecated and not maintained well enough, such as expoThree. I will try to find more ways next week.
