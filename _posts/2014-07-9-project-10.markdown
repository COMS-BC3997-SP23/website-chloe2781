description: This week I finished up the tutorial and have all the parts of a basic app up and running for both frontend and backend as well. The tutorial was very detailed and helpful, but because it was the earlier version of React Native, I had to look up more on syntax and ways to get around to have my app up and running completely. By the end of this week, I was able to have a fully functional app.
