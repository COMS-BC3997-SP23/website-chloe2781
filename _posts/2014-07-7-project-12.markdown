description: This week I finished up all of the screens and boosted through the code. It was very addicting to keep adding more components to the app.
I explored more options for AR integration, which is very limited. I explored Viro react, which is very useful for what I want because they have a snapchat like AR function. However Viro react doesn’t work with an expo management system, which is what I have, so I can’t use that. I didn’t know there was any difference between react native expo and bare react native. Expo is not very flexible with AR integration.
